# BlindWalletApp

This project offers many ideas regarding the blind in terms of providing the best possible assistance to them through an application that helps them solve many of 
the problems of their daily lives, the problems inherent in all aspects of their lives.
The main goal of this application is what we mentioned, which is to provide the greatest amount of assistance to the blind, and this will be done by solving problems 
related to the blind that they face in many situations and are considered to be simultaneous problems with them daily. One of these problems is for example: knowledge 
of money and following up on material transactions for him to the extent that It has money, knowing its location as well, time and date are problems that people need 
most in their daily lives, and for any blind man volunteer to help him, If the blind man suffers from any problem such as he cannot go to his house or any other 
problem, he can contact the volunteer to help him solve the problem.
The volunteer can deal with the location of blind.
